            Till now we have seen how HTML & CSS work together. We know now how the HTML work and what are the basic fundamental of HTML such as elements, tags, attributes. We also know how to use different elements for different contents. We have also seen how CSS works and how to target any element in the HTML document in CSS and style them according to the need. Now its time to go a bit deeper about the different elements and see how they behave once it comes to browser. We will see how elements are displayed and what will be its size in a page. During the discussion, we will get know about the box model of an element. We will also come to know about the different properties and values of CSS in our discussion. Before we directly jump to box model we will start with display properties of an element.
            From the earlier discussion, we know that by default there are two types elements, block-level elements, and inline-level elements. We have seen the difference between them. We also covered block-level elements always starts from a new line and takes the available width and inline-level elements take the space as much as it requires according to the content and lines up one after the other. In an HTML document, the block-level or the inline-level elements or something else, are all determined by the display property. Therefore, every element has a default display property value. It can be block, inline, inline-block, and none. There are a few more which we will discuss later on, for now, let's cover all these four display property values. As we all know we can overwrite any property values in CSS, in a similar way we can also overwrite the default display property values. It means we can make block to inline or inline-block and inline to block or inline-block etc. Let's see how we can do this.
